Introduction
============

Looking to work on a cool open-source project that is less mainstream? When scavenging the slew of projects on GitHub, you are not quite sure what you will find. You could explore quite a range of possibilities depending on what makes your taste buds tingle. For instance, you can find many different repositories that fit under a diverse range of categories, such as: Hacking Minecraft, Emoji's, Social Impact, and even Programming Languages. In fact, Apple's very own Swift programming language is exclusively featured as its own category (probably because it needs the extra attention :wink:). But there are less known programming languages that also exist on GitHub, the one I have in mind is the io programming language.

What is io programming language you ask? Well simply put, the io programming language boasts expressiveness through simplicity (well according to their website anyways...). It establishes that the language is pure, dynamic, concurrent and accessible.

==========================================
After forking the repository I immediately fled to the README.md in search of the build instructions. The instructions were fairly straightforward, especially if you already have homebrew installed on your OSX machine. You simply type, brew install io. Great! Works like a charm! I am now ready to write fizz-buzz in the io language! But what if I wanted to build it from scratch on my own? Well this is where I ran into some issues, even with the simple step by step instructions. I could correctly get past the first three steps, but when I ran the command 'make install' explosions went off. After countless attempts I was very unsuccessful, so I decided to temporarily give up (Artifact #2 will resume the adventure). 

I went back to the drawing board, or in this case the main io repository.
