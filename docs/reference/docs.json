All ClutterActors can be positioned, scaled and rotated in 3D space. In addition, other properties can be set, such as 2D clipping, children and opacity. Tranforms applied to a parent actor also apply to any children. Actors are also able to receive events.\n<\/p><p>\nSubclasses of ClutterActor include ClutterStage, ClutterTexture, ClutterLabel, ClutterRectangle, ClutterEntry and ClutterGroup. ClutterActors are added to a parent, transformed and then made visible.\n<\/p><p>\nClutterStage is the top level ClutterActor - it's the representation of a window, or framebuffer. It is created automatically when Clutter is initialised. ClutterStage is a ClutterGroup, a class implementing the ClutterCointainer interface.\n<\/p><p>\nClutterTimelines provide the basis for Clutter's animation utilities. Multiple timelines can be synchronised using ClutterScore, and ClutterBehaviour and ClutterEffect allow for the creation of animation effects such as transitions.\n<\/p><p>\nClutter further contains a number of utilities, including; ClutterScript - for loading 'UI definition' files formatted in JSON, ClutterShader - a class for applying GPU shaders to actors, ClutterModel - a utility class for MVC list type implementations, and fixed point math utilities.\n<\/p><p>\nFor detailed docs, see <a href=\"http:\/\/clutter-project.org\/docs\/clutter\/stable\/\">clutter-project<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n","slots":{"DEVICE_TYPE":"Contains all CLUTTER_TYPE_* constants.\n","EVENT":"Contains all Clutter event type constants.\n","keySymbolToUnicode(symbol)":"","mainLevel":"","cogl":"","EVENT_FLAG":"Contains all CLUTTER_EVENT_FLAG_* constants.\n","main":"Calls clutter_main() which starts GMainLoop.\n","motionEventsEnabled":"Returns true if motion events are enabled.\n","STAGE_STATE":"Contains all CLUTTER_STAGE_STATE_* constants.\n","UNIT":"Contains all CLUTTER_UNIT_* constants.\n","clearGlyphCache":"","ungrabKeyboard":"","getActorByGid(gid)":"","setDefaultFrameRate(frameRate)":"","threadEnter":"","version":"","grabPointer(actor[, deviceId])":"","getKeyboardGrab":"","flavour":"","threadLeave":"","isFpsShown":"","SCROLL":"Contains all CLUTTER_SCROLL_* constants.\n","enableMotionEvents":"","disableMotionEvents":"","fontHinting":"Returns <code>true<\/code> if <code>CLUTTER_FONT_HINTING<\/code> is set.\n","ungrabPointer":"","grabKeyboard(actor)":"","MASK":"Contains all CLUTTER_*_MASK constants.\n","GRAVITY":"Contains all CLUTTER_GRAVITY_* constants.\n","initThreads":"","getDefaultFrameRate":"","getPointerGrab":"","AXIS":"Contains all CLUTTER_AXIS_* constants.\n","currentEventTime":"","SHADER_ERROR":"Contains all CLUTTER_SHADER_ERROR_* constants.\n","setFontHinting(useFontHinting)":"If <code>useFontHinting<\/code> is <code>false<\/code>, <code>CLUTTER_FONT_MIPMAPPING<\/code> flag will be used.\n","quitMain":"","setSharedInt(firstInt, ...)":""},"category":"UserInterface\n","module":"Clutter"},"ClutterActorBox":{"description":"For more detailed docs see <a href=\"http:\/\/clutter-project.org\/docs\/clutter\/stable\/ClutterActor.html#ClutterActorBox\">Clutter documentation<\/a>.\n","slots":{"size":"","contains(x1, y1)":"","with(x1, y1, x2, y2)":"","origin":""},"category":"UserInterface\n","module":"Clutter"},"ClutterVertex":{"description":"For more detailed docs see <a href=\"http:\/\/clutter-project.org\/docs\/clutter\/stable\/ClutterActor.html#ClutterVertex\">Clutter documentation<\/a>.\n","slots":{"setZ(z)":"","!=(otherVertex)":"","x":"","setX(x)":"","z":"","with(x, y, z)":"","asList":"Returns [[List]] with x, y, and z values.\n","y":"","setY(y)":"","==(otherVertex)":""},"category":"UserInterface\n","module":"Clutter"},"ClutterEvent":{"description":"For more detailed docs see <a href=\"http:\/\/clutter-project.org\/docs\/clutter\/stable\/clutter-Events.html\">Clutter documentation<\/a>.\n","slots":{"keySymbol":"","time":"Returns a [[Date]] object.\n","eventType":"Returns a value from [[Clutter EVENT]].\n","hasPending":"","state":"Returns a value from [[Clutter STATE]].\n","flags":"","coords":"Returns an [[Object]] with slots <code>x<\/code> and <code>y<\/code> set.\n","source":"","relatedActor":"","device":"","button":"","x":"","y":"","scrollDirection":"","peek":"","put(event)":"","clickCount":"","keyUnicode":"","keyCode":""},"category":"UserInterface\n","module":"Clutter"}}},"Networking":{"DistributedObjects":{"MDOServer":{"description":"A Minimal Distributed Objects server.
